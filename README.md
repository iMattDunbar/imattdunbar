Welcome to my extremely average Github.

The ground rules are as follows:

- Cross platform mobile apps are always bad.
- JavaScript doesn't exist, there's only TypeScript
- Don't stick TypeScript where it doesn't need to be.
- Swift is the prettiest programming language.
- Tailwind is the only way to CSS.
- Don't overengineer stuff.
